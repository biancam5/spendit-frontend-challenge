### About 

Based on the requirements Table component has cool features such as :

-Switch between normal table and table <br>
-Pagination<br>
-Select,Edit,Delete ,Create new elements<br>

 -Each element has a unique ID, so you are not allowed to edit the ID in the modal however you are allowed to edit the name, age, and last name. This functionality prevents you from modifying the "ID" input field while editing.
